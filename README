Passwords Manager

Passwords Manager is a command line tool that offers the possibility of
creating a simple database to locally store your passwords so you can quickly
access them at any given time in case you don't remember one of them.

The database that passwords manager uses is created in the folder
~/.config/passwordsmanager and is the file passwords.txt
It's a plain text encoded. It is NOT a strong encoding and could be decoded
by anyone with basic knowledge, but it prevents other people from reading all
your data.
Also, this version still doesn't require the user to be identified to change or
access the database using the program.
With all the above explained, this is NOT a recommended program if you want to
hide important passwords (i.e. bank accounts) but it is better than storing
that information in plain text.
We also recommend creating backups of the database, just in case.
As this is still a non-stable program, backwars compatibility may be broken
with new features, so make sure to document yourself (github wiki, Changelog
and/or this README) before updating.

While using this program remember that IT IS CASE SENSITIVE


REQUIREMENTS
* *nix (Only tested on GNU/Linux, but should work on others *NIXs)
* Python 2.7+

RUN THE PROGRAM
Before running, make sure it has execution permission. If not, add it:
$ chmod +x passwords.py
And then run it:
$ ./passwords.py
If that didn't work try this:
$ python passwords.py
If this is the first time you use the program, read the help menu:
$ ./passwords.py --help
or:
$ python passwords.py --help

INSTALL THE PROGRAM
If you want to run Passwords Manager just by typing `passwords` at any given
time, you have to copy the file passwords.py into /usr/bin/ Just run the
following command to do so (as root):
# cp passwords.py /usr/bin/passwords

SOME TIPS
* If you created a database using version 0.2 or a previous one of this
  program you will have to create a new one and add one-by-one every entry or
  adapt it to the new syntax. See the wiki in the github repository for more
  information. <https://github.com/kakahuete/PasswordsManager/wiki>
* The edit feature does not exits and it will probably never exist. If you
  want to edit an entry you'll have to remove it first and then add a new one
* If you import a damaged file (i.e. that doesn't follow the program syntax)
  it will cause some problems and it should be removed
* If you want to create a database "by hand" you'll have to follow this
  syntax (if not it won't be readable by this program):
  Name of web service - Link to web service - Email - User - Password
  Note: If a field is not filled in it should be marked as a space

FEATURES:
* Create encoded database
* Read specific entries from database
* Read all entries
* Add new entries to database
* Remove specific entry from database
* Delete complete database
* Exporting database (plain text)
* Creating database backups (encoded)
* Importing database (from encoded backups or plain text exports)
* Hide passwords when writing them

FUTURE FEATURES:
* Translation into other languages
* Mix two databases
* Better security: user authentication and a 'real' encryption lgorithm
