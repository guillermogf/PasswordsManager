Passwords Manager v0.1

Passwords Manager is a command line tool that offers the possibility of
creating a simple database to locally store your passwords so you can quickly access
them at any given time in case you don't remember one of them.

The database that passwords manager uses is created in the folder
~/.config/passwordsmanager and is the file passwords.txt
It's a plain text encoded. It is NOT a strong encoding and could be decoded
by anyone with basic knowledge, but it prevents other people from reading all
your data.
Also, version 0.1 still doesn't require the user to be identified to change or
access the database using the program.
With all the above explained, this is NOT a recommended program if you want to
hide important passwords (i.e. bank accounts) but it is better than storing
that information in plain text.
We also recommend creating backups of the database, just in case.

While using this program remember that IT IS CASE SENSITIVE
