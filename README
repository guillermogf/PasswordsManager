Passwords Manager v0.1

Passwords Manager is a command line tool that offers the possibility of
creating a simple database to locally store your passwords so you can quickly
access them at any given time in case you don't remember one of them.

The database that passwords manager uses is created in the folder
~/.config/passwordsmanager and is the file passwords.txt
It's a plain text encoded. It is NOT a strong encoding and could be decoded
by anyone with basic knowledge, but it prevents other people from reading all
your data.
Also, version 0.1 still doesn't require the user to be identified to change or
access the database using the program.
With all the above explained, this is NOT a recommended program if you want to
hide important passwords (i.e. bank accounts) but it is better than storing
that information in plain text.
We also recommend creating backups of the database, just in case.

While using this program remember that IT IS CASE SENSITIVE


REQUIREMENTS
* *nix
* Python 2.7 installed

RUN THE PROGRAM
To run the application you need to make it executable:
$ chmod +x passwords.py
And then run it
$ ./passwords.py
If that didn't work try this:
$ python passwords.py
If this is the first time you use the program, read the help menu:
$ ./passwords.py --help
or:
$ python passwords.py --help

SOME TIPS
* The edit feature does not exits and it will probably never exist. If you
want to edit an entry you'll have to remove it first and then add a new one
* If you import a damaged file (i.e. that doesn't follow the program syntax)
it will cause some problems and it should be removed
* If you want to create a database "by hand" you'll have to follow this
syntax (if not it won't be readble by this program):
Name of web service - Link to web service - User - Password

FEATURES:
* Create encoded database
* Read specific entries from database
* Read all entries
* Add new entries to database
* Remove specific entry from database
* Delete complete database
* Exporting database (plain text)
* Creating database backups (encoded)
* Importing database (from encoded backups or plain text exports)
* Not show passwords when writing them

FUTURE FEATURES:
* Mix two database
* Better security (user authentication)
