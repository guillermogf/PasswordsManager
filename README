Passwords Manager
Author: Guillermo Gómez Fonfría

This is NOT a secure password manager and it should only be used with
that in mind. It was just coded as a learning experience.

Passwords Manager is a command line tool that offers the possibility of
creating a simple database to locally store your passwords so you can quickly
access them at any given time in case you don't remember one of them.

The database that passwords manager uses is created in the folder
~/.config/passwordsmanager and is the file passwords.txt
It's a plain text encoded with base64. It is NOT a real encoding for security
purposes and can be easily decoded by anyone with basic knowledge (e.g by
running: `$ base64 .config/passwordsmanager/passwords.txt` on any GNU/Linux
machine), but it prevents non-savvy-people from reading all your account info.

Apart from that, there's also the issue that the program doesn't even
require the user to identify themself to access the database.

With all the above explained, this is NOT a recommended program if you want to
hide important passwords (e.g. bank accounts) but it is still better than
storing that information in plain text in your desktop or having a sticky note
on your screen.


REQUIREMENTS
* *nix (Only tested on GNU/Linux, but should work on others *NIXs and even Win)
* Python 2.3+ (Appears to work on Python3, but it's been developed for 2.7)


RUN THE PROGRAM
$ ./passwords.py
Or:
$ python passwords.py
If this is the first time you use the program, it is recommended to read the
help menu:
$ ./passwords.py --help
or:
$ python passwords.py --help


INSTALL THE PROGRAM
If you want to run Passwords Manager just by typing `passwords` at any given
time, you can copy the program file (passwords.py) into /usr/bin/ Just run the
following command (as root):
# cp passwords.py /usr/bin/passwords


SOME TIPS
* If you created a database using version 0.2 or a previous one of this
  program you will have to create a new one and add one-by-one every entry or
  adapt it to the new syntax. See the wiki in the github repository for more
  information. <https://github.com/guillermogf/PasswordsManager/wiki>
* The edit feature does not exist and it will probably never exist. If you
  want to edit an entry you'll have to remove it first and then add a new one.
* If you import a damaged file (i.e. that doesn't follow the program syntax)
  it will cause some problems and it should be removed.
* If you want to create a database "by hand" you'll have to follow this
  syntax (if not it won't be readable by this program):
  Name of web service - Link to web service - Email - User - Password
  Note: If a field is not filled in it should be marked as a space


FEATURES:
* Create base64 databases.
* Search for specific items.
* Show all items.
* Add new items.
* Remove items.
* Delete the whole database.
* Export the database in plain text.
* Create database backups (base64 encoding).
* Import a database from encoded backups or plain text exports.


FUTURE FEATURES:
* Translation into other languages
* Mix two databases
* Better security: user authentication and a 'real' encryption algorithm
Note: This software is no longer maintained, so don't expect any new feature
or bugfix.


CONTRIBUTE
You can always start a new issue on GitHub.
If you know to code on Python and would like to colaborate directly be sure to
have pep8 checker installed on your computer and check you comply it before
creating a pull request. <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8/1.4.6>
Also take into account that I am trying to make this program as widely
compatible and 'pythonic' as possible.
